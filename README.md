# AI Fault Detection for Industrial Robots
Machine learning-based fault detection system for industrial robots (Final-year dissertation project)

## About
Industrial robots are critical in manufacturing, but faults can halt production and increase costs. 
This project predicts faults before they occur using AI, helping reduce downtime and improve efficiency.

## Features
- Detect potential faults in industrial robots using sensor data
- Predict maintenance needs proactively
- Visualize robot performance and anomalies
- Easy-to-use Jupyter Notebook workflow

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open `notebooks/fault_detection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook

## Future Work
